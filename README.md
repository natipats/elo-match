# Instructions:
To start the program simply click the green arrow, wait a few seconds, and in your preferred 
browser of choice search up http://localhost:8080/. Once you're 
online you will see the contents of the database displayed in front of you with the
option of adding, deleting, and editing entries, as well as a button labelled 
"fight" which will initiate the matchmaking and will pair users according to skill level.

## Project Description
Elo Match is a simple project in JPA that aims to use
spring tools, bootstrap, and black magic, to insert and read 
from a database and display it on a website, as well as 
make a cute matchmaking system based around the rules 
and functions of chess and chess websites.

- user can add players to the database by inputting a name and a username
- users can edit and delete contents of the database

# Future plans
